## Missing features
* There's no import/export/print feature (apart from importing Gourmet's db, that is). This is the highest
priority
* You cannot choose which database system (SQlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) you want - currently it's sqlite and a database
named "qisit.db" will be created in your home directory. Will be fixed soon

## ToDo
Apart from the missing features above
* Translations (GUI). Just has to be done.
* Nutritional information, including importing current data from the FDA

## Ideas
* How about ingredient tags? You could specify tags for the generic ingredient. 
For example: You could tag tomatoes, peppers, potatoes as "vegetarian". If all 
ingredients have this tag, the recipe itself would be considered suitable for 
vegetarians. Or for special dietary requirements, and so on.
* Menus. Plan a weekly/monthly menu plan
